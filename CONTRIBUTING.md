## I have a question!

The issues section of the repositories is generally **not** the place to ask
questions. However, it is worth checking the
[existing issues](https://github.com/nz-m/WordSage/issues) to see
if an existing bug or feature request provides enough context to answer the
question.

## I found a bug!

[existing issues](https://github.com/nz-m/WordSage/issues) to see if it has already been filed. If not, please file a new one with the [`bug` issue label](https://github.com/nz-m/WordSage/issues).

## I have a great idea!

Please check the
[existing issues](https://github.com/nz-m/WordSage/issues) to see
