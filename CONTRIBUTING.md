## I have a question!

The issues section of the repositories is generally **not** the place to ask

[existing issues](https://github.com/nz-m/WordSage/issues) to see
if an existing bug or feature request provides enough context to answer the
question.

[existing issues](https://github.com/nz-m/WordSage/issues) to see
